# -wireframing
A wireframe is a simple visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or digital product. Think of it as the blueprint for your final design.

# Key Elements of a Wireframe
ireframes are visual guides that represent the skeletal structure of a website or app. They focus on layout, functionality, and content placement without detailed design elements like colors or images. The main elements include:

### 1. Layout Structure
- **Definition:** The arrangement of headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas on a page.

### 2. Navigation
- **Definition:** Menus, links, buttons, or other components that help users move through the site or app.

### 3. Content Placement
- **Definition:** Positioning of text, images, videos, and other media within the layout.

### 4. Functionality
- **Definition:** Interactive elements and components that show how the system will behave.

  # Types of wireframes
In a traditional design process, wireframes come after on-the-fly hand-drawn sketches and right before high-fidelity mockups or prototypes.

### Low fidelity wireframing
Low fidelity is the most basic type of wireframing. Itâ€™s so simplistic, that paper and pen will still suffice as a way to represent your ideas, however, creating your wireframes in Figma will allow you to easily share them and make sure your team has access to your latest thinking as you iterate.

### High fidelity wireframing
High fidelity wireframing takes what you put together in the low fidelity stage and sprinkles in more of the detailed elements. High fidelity wireframes include visual markers and branding signifiers like colors, graphics, and font style.
